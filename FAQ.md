# Using the Community Covenant
Make reading and agreeing to its terms part of the sign-up process for your Slack community, post it prominently in your online forum, or link to it in the topic of your IRC channel.

Important! You must add a reporting method and contact email to the placeholders in the document so that people know how to report violations.

The Community Covenant is released under an MIT license, which requires that the copyright notice and permission notice be included.


# Enforcing the Community Covenant
Do not simply adopt the Community Covenant for your community and assume that any problems with civility, harassment, or discrimination will be solved. As a community leader you must be committed to enforcing the code of conduct. A code of conduct without enforcement sends a false signal that your community is welcoming and inclusive, and can create a dangerous situation for marginalized people who participate. Adopting the Community Covenant requires a responsibility that must not be taken lightly.

Before adopting the Community Covenant take the time to discuss and decide how to deal with problems as they emerge. Document the policy and procedure for enforcement, and post it in a visible, appropriate place. Consider if your administrators have the willingness and maturity to follow through on your enforcement procedures.

# Using the Contributor Covenant
We recommend that you add the Markdown or text version of the Contributor Covenant to your source code repository at the root level.

Important! You must add a contact method to the placeholder in the document so that people know how to report violations.

# Enforcing the Contributor Covenant
Do not simply add the Contributor Covenant to your project and assume that any problems with civility, harassment, or discrimination will be solved. As a project maintainer you must be committed to enforcing the code of conduct. A code of conduct without enforcement sends a false signal that your project is welcoming and inclusive, and can create a dangerous situation for marginalized people who participate. Adding the Contributor Covenant to a project places responsibility on the project team that must not be taken lightly.

Before adopting the Contributor Covenant take the time to discuss and decide how to deal with problems as they emerge. Document the policy and procedure for enforcement, and add it to your README or in another visible, appropriate place. Consider if your project team has the willingness and maturity to follow through on your enforcement procedures.
